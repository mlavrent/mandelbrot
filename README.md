# Mandelbrot & Julia sets
This repo contains explorations of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets, including the following:
- scripts to generate the Mandelbrot set and various Julia sets
- scripts to generate a sequence of Julia sets as you vary parameters (specifically the constant term for rational functions of the form $x^2 + c$).
- web app that lets you explore the convergence/divergence behavior of $x^2 + c$ for different values of $c$
